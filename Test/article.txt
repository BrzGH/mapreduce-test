We ask that you please do not send us emails privately asking for support. 
We are non-paid volunteers who help out with the project and we do not necessarily 
have the time or energy to help people on an individual basis. Instead, we have 
setup mailing lists for each module which often contain hundreds of individuals 
who will help answer detailed requests for help. The benefit of using mailing lists over 
private communication is that it is a shared resource where others can also learn from 
common mistakes and as a community we all grow together.
